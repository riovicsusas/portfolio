# Coordinator functional checks and measured local simulation

The coordinator uses Node v24.22.1 built-in SQLite for a local persistent operation ledger and virtual WMS state. SQLite is experimental in this Node release. Atomic claims and conditional shipment updates are exercised locally; no vendor API or queue service is contacted.

Functional checks cover preserved rejections, payload conflicts, pending duplicates, a cutoff changing during the request, uncertain side effects, selective release, and recovery after a separate worker exits at the post-effect boundary.

| Workload | Attempts | Concurrency | p50 response ms | p95 | p99 | Business effects |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Sequential local baseline | 50 | 1 | 4.873 | 6.5627 | 6.6896 | 50 |
| Concurrent local burst | 200 | 25 | 16.3113 | 29.4091 | 35.3097 | 200 |
| Injected WMS delay | 40 | 10 | 12.7064 | 19.122 | 20.1494 | 40 |
| Same-payload duplicate pairs | 100 | 20 | 0.0701 | 8.1744 | 8.8228 | 50 |
| Post-cutoff rejection | 20 | 5 | 0.6164 | 0.8223 | 0.8524 | 0 |
| Response loss after WMS-simulator success | 30 | 5 | 6.0062 | 8.611 | 8.9134 | 30 |

Timings use performance.now(). Percentiles use nearest-rank, ceil(p*N)-1, no interpolation. All request outcomes are retained; per-outcome statistics are available in metrics.json. Response latency includes pending, rejected and unknown results and must not be described as confirmation latency. The seed reproduces injected delays, not operating-system scheduling or measured durations. Raw per-delivery records are archived as operations.jsonl in each archived execution directory (evidence/runs/<run-id>/latency/operations.jsonl), not in the working tree.

The default smoke profile is a small local benchmark. Run --full for 10000 attempts per workload. No production latency, durable distributed locking, physical stop, SQS delivery, or vendor SLA is established.
