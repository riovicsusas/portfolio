    "fullOverview": "This Capstone Cross-Domain Case Study documents a high-severity operational failure at Synapse Botanicals manifesting at the uncoordinated seam between distributed systems. When a customer requested an urgent address change 35 minutes post-purchase, Shopify Flow accepted the edit in Admin while the downstream 3PL WMS in Reno (LOC-NV-02) suffered a database lockup returning HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout. During Shopify's 15-minute background webhook retry delay, warehouse operators printed the shipping label with the original address, crossing the irreversible Point of No Return (PONR). When the webhook finally reconnected, the 3PL rejected the edit with HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity, creating a desynchronized 'Zombie Order'. The case study establishes distributed idempotency locks, automated carrier redirect rules, and cross-domain fail-safe architecture.",
