# Algorithmic Margin Defense & Storefront Cart Diagnostics

---

## 1. Executive Summary & The Dual Storefront Threats

### 1.1 The Operational Challenge
In scaling direct-to-consumer e-commerce, the checkout funnel is vulnerable to two distinct yet equally devastating technical threats:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T1["**THREAT 1: Unrestricted Coupon Stacking Collision**
    Marketing launches separate promos: 'WELCOME15' + 'VIP20' + 'FREESHIP'.
    Without mutual exclusivity rules, customers stack all three
    on small checkout baskets.
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    FINANCIAL HAZARD: Total discounts exceed the product margin.
    Merchant generates NEGATIVE contribution margin —
    literally losing cash on every order shipped."]

    T2["**THREAT 2: Storefront AJAX Cart Freeze (HTTP 422 Silent Crash)**
    Theme scripts make async AJAX calls to /cart/add.js.
    Inventory race conditions or malformed variant payloads
    return HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity.
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    USER TRAP: Browser freezes with no visible error.
    Customer repeatedly clicks 'Checkout', assumes site is broken,
    and abandons the cart forever."]

    T1 ~~~ T2
```

### 1.2 The Engineering Solution: The Margin Protection Floor & 3-Minute Triage
This Master Protocol establishes:
1. **The 3x3 Discount Class Permutation Matrix**: Programmatically preventing invalid promo combinations.
2. **The Contribution Margin Protection Floor**: Hard math preventing net negative sales.
3. **The 3-Minute Forensic Diagnostic Framework**: Chrome DevTools network payload triage under 60 seconds MTTI.

## 2. The 3-Minute Diagnostic Framework (<60s MTTI)

When a customer or customer support reports a broken checkout or failed payment, operators must never guess. They follow a strict 3-tier forensic protocol:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Checkout Exception Reported] --> B[Tier 1: Chrome DevTools Network Tab <60s]
    B --> C{HTTP Response Code?}
    C -- 422 Unprocessable --> D[Examine Response Payload: Inventory Zero or Price Lock]
    C -- 500 / 504 --> E[Examine Downstream App / Webhook Timeout]
    C -- 200 OK --> F[Tier 2: Order Timeline Forensic Inspection <120s]
    F --> G{Payment Gateway Status?}
    G -- Failed / Declined --> H[Inspect Gateway Raw JSON Error Code ISO 8583]
    G -- Authorized --> I[Tier 3: Fulfillment Queue Webhook Audit <180s]
```

### 2.1 Layer 1: Storefront Network Tab Inspection
- Open Chrome DevTools (`F12`) $ightarrow$ Select **Network** tab $ightarrow$ Filter by `Fetch/XHR`.
- Replicate the cart action and observe `POST /cart/add.js` or `POST /cart/change.js`.
- **Raw Error Payload Telemetry**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": 422,
    "message": "Cart Error",
    "description": "You cannot add that amount to the cart -- only 0 are available in stock."
  }
  ```
- *Diagnostic Outcome*: Identified in under 45 seconds—zero inventory availability at active fulfillment node.

### 2.2 Layer 2: Payment Gateway Raw Transaction Telemetry
Payment declines must be diagnosed via the raw payment gateway response strings (Shopify Payments / Stripe Backend), not user-facing text:

| Raw Gateway Error String | ISO 8583 Code | Root Cause | Operator Action | Customer Guidance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `"decline_code": "insufficient_funds"` | `51` | Customer account lacks funds | Zero store bug; close ticket | Advise customer to use alternative card |
| `"decline_code": "card_velocity_exceeded"`| `75` | Cardholder bank fraud velocity block | Automated fraud protection | Customer must contact issuing bank |
| `"decline_code": "do_not_honor"` | `05` | Generic bank block (international card) | Bank blocking cross-border merchant | Advise customer to authorize international charge |
| `"decline_code": "expired_card"` | `54` | Expiration date expired | Input error | Verify card expiration date |

## 3. The 3x3 Discount Class Permutation & Combination Matrix

Shopify divides promotional rules into three distinct classes: **Product Discounts**, **Order Discounts**, and **Shipping Discounts**.

### 3.1 The Master Combinatorial Ruleset

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P["Product Discount
    e.g. 20% Off"]
    O["Order Discount
    e.g. \$15 Off"]
    S["Shipping Discount
    Free Freight"]

    P -->|"❌ MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE"| P
    P -->|"⚠️ RESTRICTED — Cart ≥ \$85"| O
    P -->|"✅ COMBINES"| S

    O -->|"⚠️ RESTRICTED — Cart ≥ \$85"| P
    O -->|"❌ MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE"| O
    O -->|"✅ COMBINES"| S

    S -->|"✅ COMBINES"| P
    S -->|"✅ COMBINES"| O
    S -->|"❌ MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE"| S
```

### 3.2 Key Rules:
1. **Rule 1 (Intra-Class Exclusivity)**: A product discount can *never* combine with another product discount. (No stacking 20% off on top of 15% off).
2. **Rule 2 (Inter-Class Minimum Floor)**: An order-level discount may only combine with a product-level discount if the **Cart Subtotal $ge $85.00$**.
3. **Rule 3 (Shipping Combination)**: Free Shipping promotions require a post-discount subtotal threshold $ge $50.00$.

## 4. Mathematical Modeling: Contribution Margin Protection Floor

To guarantee that no order is ever sold at a loss, every SKU enforces an algorithmic **Contribution Margin Protection Floor**:

```
CONTRIBUTION MARGIN FORMULA:
CM = (Retail Price - Total Discount) - (COGS + 3PL Handling + Carrier Freight + Merchant Processing Fee)
```

### 4.1 Unit Economics & Max Allowable Discount (Synapse Botanicals Catalog)

| Product SKU | Variant Name | Retail Price | COGS | 3PL Handling | Carrier Postage | Stripe Fee (2.9%+$0.30) | Breakeven Cost | Max Allowable Discount | Max Discount % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SYN-NB-001` | NeuroFocus Alpha (60ct) | $48.00 | $14.40 | $3.70 | $5.85 | $1.69 | **$25.64** | **$22.36** | **46.5%** |
| `SYN-NB-002` | NeuroFocus PM (60ct) | $48.00 | $14.40 | $3.70 | $5.85 | $1.69 | **$25.64** | **$22.36** | **46.5%** |
| `SYN-AT-001` | Ashwagandha Tincture | $34.00 | $8.16 | $3.70 | $5.85 | $1.29 | **$19.00** | **$15.00** | **44.1%** |
| `SYN-FG-001` | Lion's Mane Gummies | $32.00 | $10.24 | $3.70 | $5.85 | $1.23 | **$21.02** | **$10.98** | **34.3%** |
| `SYN-BD-001` | Executive Focus Bundle | $110.00 | $31.90 | $4.50 | $7.20 | $3.49 | **$47.09** | **$62.91** | **57.1%** |

> **Critical Threshold**: For low-margin items like *Lion's Mane Gummies*, any discount exceeding **34.3%** pushes the order into negative gross contribution margin!

## 5. Empirical Incident Autopsy: Order #1063 Collision Simulation

To demonstrate the financial destruction of uncontrolled discount stacking, a live simulation was executed on Synapse Botanicals' staging store.

### 5.1 Baseline Order Configuration
- **Order ID**: `#1063`
- **Basket Items**:
  - 1x Lion's Mane Gummies (`SYN-FG-001`) = $32.00
  - 1x Ashwagandha Tincture (`SYN-AT-001`) = $34.00
- **Cart Gross Value**: **$66.00**

### 5.2 The Unrestricted Collision Event
Customer applied three separate coupons during checkout:
1. `VIP20`: 20% off all products (-$13.20)
2. `WELCOME15`: $15.00 off order (-$15.00)
3. `FREESHIP`: Free Ground Shipping (-$6.50 shipping fee waived)

```
FINANCIAL DISASTER AUDIT — Order #1063 (PRE-FIX):
  Gross Revenue Collected:      $66.00 − $13.20 (VIP20) − $15.00 (WELCOME15) = $37.80
  Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):    −$10.24 (Gummies) + −$8.16 (Tincture)        = −$18.40
  3PL Warehouse Handling:       −$4.10 (Base + pick + box)
  Carrier Outbound Freight:     −$6.50 (Paid by merchant — Free Shipping)
  Credit Card Gateway Fee:      −$1.40
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  NET ORDER CONTRIBUTION:       $37.80 − $18.40 − $4.10 − $6.50 − $1.40 = −$4.80 (LOSS!)
```
*Result*: The store **lost $4.80 in pure cash** by fulfilling this order!

### 5.3 Post-Remediation Execution (With Matrix Protection Applied)
With the combinatorial exclusivity engine deployed:
1. Customer inputs `VIP20` $ightarrow$ Applied (-$13.20).
2. Customer attempts `WELCOME15` $ightarrow$ **Blocked by Checkout Extensibility**:
   > *"Discount code WELCOME15 cannot be combined with VIP20 on baskets under $85.00."*
3. Customer receives standard shipping calculation ($6.50) because post-discount cart is $52.80.
4. **Final Net Contribution Margin**: **+$17.14 (32.4% net profit margin)**.
